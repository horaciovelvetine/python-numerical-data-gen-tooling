    Generate a condition time series (historical condition estimates) for an
    asset given its current age (in years) and current condition index. The
    function computes the condition index for each historical year (up to the
    last 10 years or as far back as possible), reversing the effect of
    exponential decay, and records the estimated yearly and monthly condition
    values in a dictionary. The current month's value is set to the actual
    current_condition_index. Returns a dictionary containing keys "year" and
    "months", each mapping to a dictionary of historical condition values.
